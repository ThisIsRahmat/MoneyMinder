# MoneyMinder

A financial assistant web application built with: Next.js (Typescript) + Golang. 

This project was started with the intention of participating in the appwrite hackathon but then I never completed it in time.
The goal of this project is to build a more functioning personal finance/budgeting app that can be used to stay on track with my financial goals. 

I have tried aa bunch of the different ones out there but they didn't really meet my expectations for a personal finance app. 

The other goal of this project is so I could master Golang, right now my Go is decent but I would like to get some more practice so I hope by building MoneyMinder I would become a Golang pro.
